Junior Web Developer

Fun-Fact About Me:

I have always had an interest in web design. 
I created my first web-page at age 12 on a site called Neopets. It was only a front end job, 
but it was this experience that lead me in to the direction of web development. I believe that
following your own creativity is the best way to learn.
