My Github - Welcome
===================
Digital Marketer.


I have always had an interest in web design. 
 I have a Marketing degree and a 2 year computer programmer diploma from Seneca. I love marketing, web development and graphic design. I try to use all three skills to create projects of my own. I believe
following your own creativity is the best way to learn. 
I specialize in Digital Marketing with competencies in Graphic Design and Web Development. In this digital age, you cannot avoid computer programming, I chose to embrace it.

On this github, I have posted some of my Javascript, C++ and Oracle SQL projects.
