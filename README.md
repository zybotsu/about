My Github - Welcome
===================
Digital Marketer.


I have always had an interest in web design. 
I created my first web-page at the age 12 on a site called Neopets. These micro experiences have led me in to the direction of web development. I have a 2 year computer programmer diploma from Seneca. I love marketing, web development and graphic design. I try to use all three skills to create projects of my own. I believe
following your own creativity is the best way to learn. 
Although I specialize in Digital Marketing with competencies in Graphic Design and Web Development. In this digital age, you cannot avoid computer programming, I chose to embrace it.
